ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Shaheerk786-bit

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, with a particular focus on web technologies and Python programming. I'm enthusiastic about creating user-friendly, efficient applications and staying abreast of emerging tech trends.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in the final year of my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. Alongside my studies, I'm learning JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.js to boost my front-end development skills. Additionally, I'm delving into cloud services like AWS and Azure for insights on application deployment and management.
ðŸ˜Ž Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those related to web development or Python. I have a keen interest in contributing to projects that have a positive social impact or serve educational purposes.
